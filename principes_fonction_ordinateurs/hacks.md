# "hacking" university
This year, thanks to COVID-19, universities can't evaluate students using the typical "try to be a calculator" system. This is great for both students and teachers.

Teachers are forced to actually make us think. They can't ask us to just find the solution to an equation, we can simply use Wolfram Alpha for that.

Students are forced to be smart. We can't just content ourselves by trying to be as good as calculators. We actually have to think and be smart.

## What is in this repo
I'm currently studying at the *University of Geneva* and this is part of my exam preparation. Mostly python scripts to automate questions that we might get asked to avoid me doing silly mistakes. 

I'm basically giving computer work back to computers :) 

## Is this allowed?
Yep, our exams are fully open book and open web. We can use any ressource we want except communicate between students.
